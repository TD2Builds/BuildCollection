YT Video, Reddit link, etc.) so a proper understanding of the build can be achieved.\n\n<!-- \nThis is both documentation and [demo](Demo.md) of [git-wiki theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme) project.\n\nit's a **modular and full featured wiki** powered by git, [github](https://pages.github.com/)/[gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/) pages and pull-requests!\n\nThe git-wiki project is composed by 3 different repository:\n\n- [git-wiki-theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme): This is the repository of the theme that implements the wiki functionalities. You would have not fork it unless you need to send a Pull Request or create your wiki project from scratch.\n\n- [git-wiki-skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton): This is the repo that you should fork or use as a template. It uses the [jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) functionality that allows you to create your own wiki based on git-wiki-theme. By using the remote functionality you can automatically keep your wiki always updated with latest features from the **git-wiki-theme**, but you can also fully customize it. \n\n- [git-wiki](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki): This is the documentation repository and website of the **git-wiki-theme** project. You would have not fork it unless you want to contribute to the git-wiki project documentation.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe easier and faster way to use git-wiki is the \"skeleton\" method.\n\n**You don't need to install anything locally!**\n\n1. Simply fork/clone [skeleton repo](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton) or click on \"Use this template\" button to create your copy of the skeleton project.\n\n2. Edit _config.yml and other pages as you need and then deploy it on github/gitlab pages.\n\n**Done**! now wait that your page will be published and you're ready **_to wiki_**!\n\nFor more installation options see the [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions)\n\n## Features \n\n* Improvements in the **cooperative** aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.\n* You can **customize your wiki** as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout. (see customization section below) \n* **No databases!** Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.\n* **Blazing fast** and free thankfully to Github/Gitlab Pages and Jekyll Server Side Generation process!\n* **Markdown and html** mixed together!\n* **Multiple free search engines!** on a static site!\n* **History, revision comparison** and everything you need from a wiki platform.\n* You can **edit your pages** with the standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefer.\n* Non-existent wiki page links are \"[red](red.md)\", you can **click on them to automatically create a new page**!\n* [External links](http://www.google.com) get the right icon automatically\n* **Component system with hooks** that allows you to totally customize your wiki UI. (see customization section below) \n* Some **nice internal themes** to change your entire wiki UI with 1 simple configuration (see customization section below)\n* Integrated **Blogging** feature thanks to jekyll!\n* Automatic generated **TOC**\n* You can download the entire wiki for **offline** usage and even navigate directly using a markdown reader\n\n\nYou can use it with jekyll [\"remote_theme\"](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) feature or fork/copy the master branch and start your wiki in just 1 minute*.\n\nGit-wiki can be used as [theme for jekyll](https://jekyll-themes.com/git-wiki/)\n\n *Github/Gitlab pages takes about 10 minutes to show up the first time you configure it\n\n**Note:**\nYou can even include the [official github wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) as a submodule and enable the option in our conf file to use github wiki pages in git-wiki system, but it's an experimental feature and it implies less advantages and greater disadvantages for now.\n\n## Who is using git-wiki\n\n[List of git-wiki installations](examples.md)\n\n[List of forked repository](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme/network/members)\n\n\n### [Share your wiki with us!](examples) and keep the \"Powered by Git-Wiki\" footer link please. It will help both of us!\n\n\n## Installation instructions\n\n### Remote theme method\n\n1. Fork, Clone [the skeleton repository](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton) or click on \"Use this template\" button to create your copy.\n\n2. Edit _config.yml and other pages as you need and then deploy it on github/gitlab pages.\n\n**Description**: This method will allow you to create a wiki based on our skeleton repository and that extends git-wiki-theme. \n\n**Direct installation comparison**:\n\n + **pros**: This will allow you to avoid upgrading process pulling files from git-wiki-theme and eventually merge them.\n\n - **cons**: To edit/fix git-wiki-theme core files you need to configure a second repository forked by git-wiki-theme repo. However, [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)\n\n**GITLAB SUPPORT**: if you want to fork the skeleton from gitlab, you can use [this repo](https://gitlab.com/drassil/git-wiki-skeleton)\n\n**Without skeleton**: you can avoid to use the skeleton repository if you want start from scratch, however it's important to use at leaset the configuration variables needed by the theme: [_config.yml](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton/blob/master/_config.yml)\n\n### Direct installation method\n\n1. Fork, Clone [git-wiki-theme repository](https://github.com/drassil/git-wiki-theme) or click on \"Use this template\"\n\n2. Edit _config.yml and push your changes in your repository, then configure the github/gitlab pages in your repository settings\n\n**Description**: This method will allow you to create a wiki using git-wiki-theme directly. You can create your theme from scratch. It's for advanced users and people who want directly collaborate to git-wiki-theme project.\n\n**Remote installation comparison**:\n\n + **pros**: You can build your wiki and collaborate with git-wiki-theme project by PR at the same time.\n\n - **cons**: Upgrading your wiki to the latest version need a merge with git-wiki-theme repo.\n\n\n### Notes:\nIn both cases please is preferred to use **Fork** instead of **Template** and **Template** instead of **Clone** (Fork > Template > Clone).\nFork will allow you to make pull request to/from original repository to keep your files updated (for skeleton too). Please, keep everything open and collaborative!\n\n\n### Local development\n\nIf you need to work on git-wiki locally before publish, then clone your wiki repo and follow this instructions \nfrom official github article: <https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/>\nGit wiki already contains the Gemfile for local installations.\n\nYou can also use our **docker files** to run git-wiki under **docker**, \nthe easiest method is to run `docker-compose up` command in this folder\n\n## Configuration and customization\n\n* [How to customize your wiki](customize.md)\n\n* [How to setup the search feature](search-feature.md)\n\n## Current known limitations\n\n* You can't use the wiki internal link format: [[example]]. Please, use gh-pages links instead: \\[example\\](example) . It's a known jekyll limitation: <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/>\n\n\n## Support & Collaboration\n\nYou can open a public issue on [github](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki/issues) , \nsend a private <a href=\"mailto:staff-drassil@googlegroups.com\">email</a> or create a PR to improve it.\n\nThank you!\n\n## Components used\n\n- [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc)\n\n- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for DOM manipulation\n\n[MIT LICENSE](/BuildCollection/LICENSE) -->\n","dir":"/","name":"index.md","path":"index.md","url":"/"},{"sort":1,"layout":"default","title":"Informations, Links n more","content":"<h1 id=\"informations-links-n-more\">Informations, Links n more</h1>\n","dir":"/informationCollection/","name":"index.md","path":"informationCollection/index.md","url":"/informationCollection/"},{"sort":2,"layout":"default","title":"Builds","content":"<h1 id=\"builds\">Builds</h1>\n<p>In this section you will find a collection of various builds.\nThey are ordered in subcategories and tagged with certain tags.</p>\n\n<p>Possible tags are:\nPVE, PVP,\nRaid, Summit, FreeRoam, Missions,\nLegendary, Heroic,\nShotgun, AR, SMG, Marksman, LMG, Pistol,\nGearset, Brandset, Improvised,\nShield, NoShield</p>\n\n<p>To add new builds make a pullrequest with the new build in the given format placed in the corresponding subcategory.</p>\n","dir":"/builds/","name":"index.md","path":"builds/index.md","url":"/builds/"}]
